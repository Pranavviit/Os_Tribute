            Kobe Bryant, in full Kobe Bean Bryant, (born August 23, 1978, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.
            died January
            26, 2020, Calabasas, California), American professional basketball player, who helped lead the Los Angeles
            Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five championships (2000–02 and 2009–10).

            Bryant’s father, Joe (“Jelly Bean”) Bryant, was a professional basketball player who spent eight seasons in
            the NBA and eight more playing in Italy, where Bryant went to school. When his family returned to the United
            States, Bryant played basketball at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where he received
            several national Player of the Year awards and broke the southeastern Pennsylvania scoring record set by
            Wilt Chamberlain with 2,883 points. Bryant opted to forgo college and declared himself eligible for the NBA
            draft when he graduated from high school. The Charlotte Hornets chose him with the 13th pick of the 1996
            draft. He was traded to the Lakers shortly thereafter and became the second youngest NBA player in history
            when the 1996–97 season opened. He quickly proved his merit with the Lakers and was selected for the NBA
            All-Star Game in just his second season, becoming the youngest All-Star.

                <i>I remember when, as a kid, I got my first real basketball.</i><br> <i>From a young age, Kobe had an intrinsic motivation to do anything necessary to become a top-notch basketball player. Kobe wanted to be great, and he knew that, in order to achieve that, he had to work harder than everyone else and make sacrifices others were unwilling to make. Throughout his career, Kobe maintained a grueling schedule, which included both early mornings and late nights of practice, workouts, and film sessions. While other players eased up on their workouts during the season to avoid wearing themselves out, Kobe carried on. Although his schedule was tiring, it also helped him maintain endurance throughout the season and into the playoffs.
